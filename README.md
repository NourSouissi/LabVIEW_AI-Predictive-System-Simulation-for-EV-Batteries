# LabVIEW AI Predictive System Simulation for EV Batteries

## 📌 Description
This project simulates a predictive maintenance system for electric vehicle (EV) batteries using LabVIEW and AI integration. 
It monitors voltage, current, and temperature signals, calculates key performance indicators, and applies predictive algorithms to detect anomalies such as EMI, voltage drops, and thermal issues.

## ⚡ Features
- LabVIEW-based simulation of EV battery signals (voltage, current, temperature).
- EMI detection through current/voltage fluctuation analysis.
- Battery health monitoring via voltage drop over time.
- Thermal protection by detecting sudden temperature rises.
- AI integration (Python node in LabVIEW) for anomaly detection.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **LabVIEW 2024 Q3**
- **Python** (for AI module)
- **Simulated signals** for testing

## 🚗 Use Case
This project demonstrates how predictive maintenance can improve the safety and reliability of EV battery systems by detecting issues early and triggering corrective actions such as cooling or shutdown.
